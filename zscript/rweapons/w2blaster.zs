class RwBlaster : RandomizedWeapon {
    // A pistol alternative that runs off an internal battery.
    // Instead of ammo, its firerate drops off dramatically as it heats up.
    // The idea is that this is a weapon you want to use in between other weapons; it works best in short bursts and 'cools down' while in your pocket.
    // Partly inspired by the Treasure Tech pistol's altfire--again, high burst damage, but it's at its best when you have other weapons on hand.

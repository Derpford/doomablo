# Doomablo: a looter-shooter Doom mod
**DOOM and Diablo are two of the most well-known games about fighting demon hordes. Let's merge them, will we?**
DOOMablo (the title is not final, though) is a mod inspired by BorderDoom and Doom: Infinite which transforms DOOM into a looter-shooter in the vein of Diablo. Kill demons, grab randomly generated weapons and armor with various affixes, so that you could kill more demons and find even better loot!

## What's included:
- All of DOOM weapons (except the fist), as well as the monsters are now randomizable!
- Random names for your unique artifacts
- More than 100 applicable affixes
- Item quality system to ensure the numbers to be varied
- Progression system (progressively increasing the loot quality while you play)
- Player experience levels and upgradable player stats
- A rarity system with common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary and mythic items.
- Most of the weapons now have recoil (so mouselook is required) and reload (don't forget to bind reload button!)
- Bigger enemies drop better loot
- No save scumming prevention, play as you wish!


## Prerequisites and running:
- You will need GZDoom v.4.10.0 or later and DOOM.WAD or DOOM2.WAD. The mod should work with Freedom, although it was not tested.
- Just run this mod like you usually run GZDoom mods. Doomablo usually should be after your monster packs in the mods order.
- **Use the fullscreen HUD** to see Doomablo UI elements. **Statusbar (default DOOM UI) won't work!** Just press "+" key when you e.g can't see item stats.
- Enable the mouselook!
- Visit DOOMablo settings to configure the needed keys.
- If monster's health bars look strange or unreadable, you can configure them in DOOMablo settings.

## Compatibility:
- The mod works both with Doom 1 and Doom 2.
- This mod should (but not guaranteed to) be compatible with any non-heavily scripted map packs. Compatibility with map packs is a high priority for me, so please report any incompatibilities and/or mappack-related bugs.
- This mod should (but not guaranteed to) be compatible with most non-heavily scripted monster packs. Monster pack ccompatibility is somewhat of a lower priority.
- This mod is compatible with Nashgore. In fact, I'm testing it without ever disabling Nashgore.
- **This mod is NOT compatible with any mods that alter weapons and/or armor.** Sadly, universal compatibility is not quite possible at this stage, as there is too much custom logic involved. To compensate for that, I'm targeting to implement more weapons inside this mod itself in the future to ensure enough variety even without third party weapon mods.
